      <h2>Attending Goalkeepers 2023</h2>
      <p>
        I had the incredible opportunity to attend the 2023 Goalkeepers Conference, hosted by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It was an honor to be part of this remarkable event and to connect with industry leaders and changemakers who are equally passionate about addressing critical global issues. <br><br>

        The theme of this year's conference, focusing on the maternal mortality rate, struck a deep chord with me, particularly as a Black woman. The discussions and insights shared over those two days were not only eye-opening but also incredibly inspiring. It's evident that there is a collective commitment to tackling this urgent problem and creating lasting change.<br><br>

        I also had the privilege of hearing from standout speakers who left a profound impact on me like Kathryn Finney who spoke on the importance of bringing and nurturing black women in the venture capitalist space, Mavis Owusu-Gyamfi and Bill Gates on steps to transform the current financial architecture to support and uplift nations in Africa, and Hamdi Ulukaya on his unique approach to a "human-first" company culture to support his workers and beyond. <br><br>

        Additionally, it was an honor to listen to the perspectives of global leaders, including Prime Minister Fumio Kushida, President William Ruto, and Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, who shared their visions for a more equitable and sustainable future. <br><br>

        Attending the Goalkeepers Conference empowered me to take meaningful action. It reinforced my belief in the power of collaboration, innovation, and purpose-driven initiatives to drive positive change in our world.
